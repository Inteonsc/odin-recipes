    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A classic english dish of sausages (BANGERS), mash potatoes and gravy.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 links pork sausage</li>
        <li>2 pounds potatoes peeled and cubed</li>
        <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dry mustard powder</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>2 large onions</li>
        <li>6 cups beef broth</li>
        <li>2 cups red wine</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95c)</li>
        <li>Cook sausages in a skillet over medium-low heat until browned, about 5 minutes per side; transfer to an oven-safe dish and keep warm in the preheated oven.</li>
        <li>Place potatoes into a saucepan over medium heat and cover with water; bring to a boil and simmer until potatoes are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two. Mix in 1/4 cup of butter, dry mustard, salt, and black pepper; mash until fluffy and smooth. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions; cook and stir until translucent and just starting to brown, about 8 minutes. Pour in beef broth and red wine; bring to a boil and simmer until reduced to half its volume, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Serve sausages with mashed potatoes; pour onion gravy on top.</li>
    </ol>
